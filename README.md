# ✍️ Blog Management System

## Overview

This full stack project is designed to build a dynamic blogging platform where users can create, edit, delete, and explore blog posts. It provides features like markdown-based editors, image support, user authentication, and categorization of content — simulating the foundational elements behind many real-world content publishing systems.

The system emphasizes structured content creation, real-time previews, and access control for different user roles like writers, readers, and editors.
